Handlers of the type VOID will be all executed in the order they have been 
   registered disregarding their return values. Though in mod_perl they are 
   expected to return Apache::OK.

Handlers of the type RUN_FIRST will be executed in the order they have been 
   registered until the first handler that returns something other than 
   Apache::DECLINED. If the return value is Apache::DECLINED, the next handler 
   in the chain will be run. If the return value is Apache::OK the next phase 
   will start. In all other cases the execution will be aborted.

Handlers of the type RUN_ALL will be executed in the order they have been 
   registered until the first handler that returns something other than 
   Apache::OK or Apache::DECLINED.
